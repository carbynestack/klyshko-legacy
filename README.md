# Carbyne Stack Klyshko Correlated Randomness Generation

Klyshko is an open source correlated randomness generator for Secure Multiparty
Computation in the offline/online model and part of
[Carbyne Stack](https://github.com/carbynestack).

## Namesake

_Klyshko_ is one of the inventors of _spontaneous parametric down-conversion_
(SPDC). SPDC is an important process in quantum optics, used especially as a
source of entangled photon pairs, and of single photons (see
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_parametric_down-conversion)).
The analogy to the _Klyshko_ service is that secret shared tuples are kind of
"entangled" and that the microservice is the implementation of the process that
creates the tuples.

## Klyshko Integration Interface

_Klyshko_ has been designed to allow for easy integrating different correlation
randomness generators (CRGs). Integration is done by means of providing a docker
image containing the CRG that implements the _Klyshko Integration Interface_
(KII).

> **TIP**: For an example of how to integrate the
> [MP-SPDZ](https://github.com/data61/MP-SPDZ) CRG producing _fake_ tuples see
> the [klyshko-mp-spdz](klyshko-mp-spdz) module.

### Entrypoint

The CRG docker image must contain a `kii-run.sh` script in the working directory
that performs the tuple generation process. The script must terminate with a
non-zero exit code in case the tuples can not be generated.

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are passed into CRG containers to control
the tuple generation and provisioning process.

#### Input

- `KII_JOB_ID`: The Type 4 UUID used as a job identifier. This is the same among
  all VCPs in the VC. among all VCPs in the VC.
- `KII_TUPLES_PER_JOB`: The number of tuples to be generated. The CRG should try
  to match the requested number but is not required to do so.
- `KII_PLAYER_NUMBER`: The 0-based number of the local VCP.
- `KII_PLAYER_COUNT`: The overall number of VCPs in the VC.
- `KII_TUPLE_TYPE`: The tuple type to generate. Must be one of
  - `bit_gfp`, `bit_gf2n`
  - `inputmask_gfp`, `inputmask_gf2n`
  - `inversetuple_gfp`, `inversetuple_gf2n`
  - `squaretuple_gfp`, `squaretuple_gf2n`
  - `multiplicationtriple_gfp`, `multiplicationtriple_gf2n`
- `KII_LOCAL_PORT`: The network port the local CRG listens on.
- `KII_ENDPOINTS_FILE`: The path to the network endpoint file (see below).

#### Output

- `KII_TUPLE_FILE`: The file the generated tuples must be written to.

### Prime

The prime to be used for generating prime field tuples is provided in the file
`/etc/kii/params/prime`.

### MAC Key Shares

The MAC key shares for prime and binary fields are made available as files
`mac_key_share_p` and `mac_key_share_2` in folder `/etc/kii/secret-params`.

### Endpoints

The endpoints of all CRGs are provided in file at the location specified by
`KII_ENDPOINTS_FILE`. The file consists of `KII_PLAYER_COUNT` lines following
the syntax`<IP>:<PORT>` where line `i` in `[0, KII_PLAYER_NUMBER-1]` denotes the
IP address `IP` and the port `PORT` the party with player number
`KII_PLAYER_NUMBER` is listening on.

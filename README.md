## Namesake

_Klyshko_ is one of the inventors of _spontaneous parametric down-conversion_ 
(SPDC). SPDC is an important process in quantum optics, used especially as a 
source of entangled photon pairs, and of single photons 
(see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_parametric_down-conversion)). 
The analogy to the _Klyshko_ service is that secret shared tuples are kind of 
"entangled" and that the microservice is the implementation of the process that 
creates the tuples.
